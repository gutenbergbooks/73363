<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> new species, of Thunberg’s new genus Sanseviera, which is a branch of the Linnæan genus
Aletris; was introduced into this country from China, by T. Evans, Esq. of Stepney; in the year 1792:
but is still very rare. Our drawing was made from a fine plant in the collection of J. Vere, Esq. of
Kensington Gore, in the month of March<a id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>. Mr. Anderson, his botanic gardener, informs us, he has
treated it as a hothouse plant; but it will probably be found to succeed better in the greenhouse,
like other Chinese plants. It is propagated by parting the roots. In habit it resembles Hemerocallis
more than Sanseviera, but agrees with the generical characters of Sanseviera zeylanica. With
Aletris fragrans it also agrees in many particulars; but with Aletris farinosa is quite at variance.</p>

systematic writer except Miller; who has described it accurately under the name of <i>biflorus</i>, in the
8th edition of his celebrated Dictionary. It is very hardy, flowers early in February, and may be
readily distinguished from other Crocuses by its leaves being much longer than the flowers, at the
time of flowering. When the sun shines strong, the flowers have a just perceptible fragrant scent;
a circumstance very unusual in this genus; all the other species, (one we call <i>fragrans</i> excepted) having
more or less of an unpleasant smell. It seldom produces seeds in this country, or varies in colour;
but increases by the root.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>In the structure of the flowers this species agrees exactly with the common Polygala Heisteria,
which Linnæus originally made a distinct genus from Polygala; but afterwards united them. In
keeping them distinct we think he did right; but wrong in uniting them. Our readers will have an
opportunity of judging for themselves in our next number, in which will be figured a true Polygala,
and another of the Heisteria family; with proper dissections of each.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> splendid but fugitive plant, is strikingly emblematic of the short duration of superior beauty:
its flower is but the transient object of a day; and its whole life in Europe seldom exceeds a single year!</p>

<p>The Peacock-Iris, notwithstanding its attractions, is but imperfectly understood by the Botanists
and Horticulturists of this country; for while the latter have been unsuccessful in cultivating it: some
of the former have privately considered it as a new Genus: some have referred it to Iris, Morea, or
Ferraria; others with more propriety to De la Roche’s Genus Vieusseuxia; and the usually accurate
Curtis mistook and figured the widely-different Iris tricuspis for it.</p>

<p>The English Gardens have several times possessed this charming species, but we are afraid it is at
present entirely lost to them. Our figure therefore, taken from the Hibbertian collection some time
since, cannot fail to be highly acceptable to all lovers of plants.</p>

<p>In root Iris Pavonia resembles other Cape Irides; but the varying lustres of its brilliant flowers are
seldom equalled; and not much excelled by any plant we ever saw. It is a native of the Cape,
flowers early in Spring; and must be treated like the other bulbous species from that country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

increases slowly by the root, but sometimes ripens seeds in this country. It commences flowering in
the beginning of February, before the common Scilla bifolia; but continues in beauty long after that
plant is past; and although perfectly hardy, its flowers are liable to be injured by strong frosts, unless
occasionally protected.</p>

<p>It thrives well in a light soil, and warm situation; but, like all dwarf plants, appears to most advantage
in a pot: and indeed, succeeds best with the treatment usually given to alpine plants.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> new and elegant species of Anagallis, the largest and most showy of that genus hitherto discovered,
was introduced into England, we believe, in the last year; but by whom, or from what country, we have
not yet satisfactorily ascertained. It is reported to be of African origin, and to have come to England
from the Paris garden. Our figure was made from a plant trained up near three feet high, in Lady
De Clifford’s collection at Paddington, where it is treated as a green-house plant. We have not yet
seen it produce good seeds, although apparently an annual plant; but it is easily increased by cuttings
in the usual way. In every thing except size, and in having more entire petals, it very much resembles
Anagallis arvensis; a plant truly remarkable for being the only one indigenous to Britain (the Poppies
excepted) with scarlet flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pæonia suffruticosa is perhaps the most showy and desirable species, in this short but magnificent
genus of plants. To the striking peculiarity of a shrubby stem, it unites the advantages of
superior size; a profusion of very large flowers; and a facility of culture which ensures an annual
succession of them: no wonder, therefore, that it is assiduously sought after by all who admire the
beauties of Flora.</p>

<p>The shrubby Pæony was introduced into Britain in the year 1794, from China; where, as well as
in Japan, many varieties of it are said to be common in almost every garden. We conceive it to be
extremely distinct as a species, from the P. officinalis of all authors except Thunberg and Loureiro:
yet Professor Willdenow has not enumerated it in his edition of Species Plantarum. Although introduced
so long since, it is still rare; and must be treated as a very hardy green-house plant: indeed it
succeeds best when planted in the earth and protected by a glass case; is propagated by slipping the
roots, and by cuttings. All the plants hitherto received from China have double flowers; and among
them there are two varieties; the rosy one here figured, from the Clapham collection; and another
with purplish petals, the bases of which are of a still deeper colour. Flowers in April, making a
very fine appearance; but is nearly scentless.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

All the species it contains are at once the favourites of the Botanist, the Gardener, and the
Florist. The former, with pleasing satisfaction, contemplates their polished beauties still undiminished
in his herbarium; while the latter find them (if sufficiently guarded from humidity) of easy management
and ready growth. They bloom annually, and their durable and highly finished empalements
are gathered and used in decorating many a mantle-piece; long, very long after they have ceased to
live: whence the name of Eternal Flower. Many species of Gnaphalium possess a similar durability;
and we have seen dried bouquets of both united, which were extremely beautiful.</p>

<p>The proliferous Eternal Flower is shrubby, commences flowering in May, lasts a long time in
bloom, and in point of singularity and showiness yields to few of its congeners. It is a Cape plant:
succeeds with the treatment of several species figured before by us; and is propagated by cuttings: was

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Xeranthemum</span> bracteatum has the appearance of proving as hardy an annual as a China Aster or
French Marygold; and if so, will prove a considerable acquisition to our open borders; as it ripens
its seeds well, and they vegetate readily.</p>

<p>In being annual, it recedes in its nature from all the species of the genus we are acquainted with,
except X. annuum of Linnæus; which, however, we think, with Jussieu, of a perfectly distinct
genus; on account of its squamous receptacle; and its variety (inapertum) a distinct species: the
structure of the receptacle in the extensive class Syngenesia being of great consequence in the formation
and distribution of genera.</p>

<p>The seedlings of the waved-leaved Eternal Flower are best raised early, like China Asters, on a gentle
hot-bed, and, when large enough, should be transplanted out in showery weather, where they are intended
to remain: they will become erect and bushy, attain the height of three feet or upwards, and
produce their polished, golden-coloured flowers in autumn, in profusion. Possessing no recent specimens
in bloom, we have omitted a technical description. Our drawing was made last summer, from
fine living plants at Mr. Colvill’s, Nurseryman, in the King’s Road; who raised it in the year 1799
from Port Jackson seeds sent him by Colonel Paterson.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Although</span> now an old inhabitant of the British gardens, Allium Chamæ-Moly has ever been considered
as a rare and interesting one; and is at present extremely scarce. It has several times been
entirely lost to us, and again introduced from the south of Europe; where it occurs spontaneously.</p>

<p>In the Hortus Kewensis of Mr. Aiton, it is marked as a hardy species: perhaps inadvertently:
because we never knew it survive a single winter in the open ground near London: notwithstanding
our having repeatedly tried it, in situations by no means unfavourable: hence, possibly, its present
rarity.</p>

<p>It is properly a hardy green-house plant: requires a light soil, and the treatment of an Ixia: increases
both by offsets from the root, and by seeds: and flowers annually in the months of January and
February. The leaves die down in April or May. In the structure of the flowers, but not the
spathe, it agrees with Allium gracile of this work, which is not the gracile of the Hortus Kewensis.
The genus Allium is an extensive one; but the present is the least species in it, and possesses the
shortest stalk. Cavanilles describes and figures the style as subulate and entire; but in our plant that
part is forked: and the spathe in his plant differs much from ours.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

and in the structure of the leaves, it resembles its supposed mother the Rhododendron ponticum;
but in their deciduous nature, and in some parts of the inflorescence; and likewise in other
particulars; it betrays a considerable similitude to the American Azaleæ.</p>

<p>The pontic Rhododendron is a very sportive species; varies much in the formation and colour
of its corolla; and we cultivate a strong variety of it with the flowers of R. maximum. The present
variety has not any of its undulated flowers spotted with yellow, no more than that which is figured
by Pallas in Flora Rossica: yet the spotting of the three superior segments of the corolla is pretty constant
in most of the varieties which we have examined; and is even present, although faintly, in
R. maximum. Our figure was taken at Whitley and Brames’s in the month of May.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

the other species of the genus, and is propagated in the same manner. The leaves are linear-lanced,
embrace the stem alternately, and when old are often reflexed in an imbricated manner: they are
clothed, as well as the stems, with wool; and resemble fine woollen cloth to the touch, and often have
their edges and points of a purplish rusty colour. The bracteated peduncles are from one to three in
number, at the end of each branch. The young flowers are more highly coloured than the old ones,
which sometimes assume a nodding attitude: when aged they bleach almost white, except the points
of the calycine scales, which always retain a purplish blotch.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Campanula laciniata, although introduced into the British gardens so long since as the year 1790,
is still a very scarce species: this is not owing to a want of beauty, but to its having a biennial root,
and not perfecting its seeds well, except in favourable situations. It was originally discovered by the
celebrated French traveller and botanist Tournefort, about a century since, on a remarkable rock in the
Island of Sikino in Greece; where he appears to have been highly delighted with its beauty and appearance,
and says it is “<i>the fairest Campanula in all Greece</i><a id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>.” However applicable this encomium
may have been in those days, it ceases to be so now; for, without detracting from the fairness and
beauty of the present plant, we have in cultivation another Grecian Campanula, still more fair and
beautiful, and much more rare, which we hope soon to have the pleasure of presenting to our subscribers.</p>

<p>The Ragwort-leaved Campanula is usually treated as an alpine plant, and wintered in a frame: it is
increased by seeds, and is impatient of superfluous moisture.</p>

extensive genus; no fewer than 214 distinct species of which we have now a knowledge of<a id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>.</p>

<p>M. inclaudens rises with a branched, shrubby stem, to the height of 10 or 12 inches, and is cultivated
in the same manner, and propagated with the same facility, that is common and well known in
this tribe: they are all very hardy green-house plants; require in winter as much air as possible, if
frost is but avoided; strike freely from cuttings; are great lovers of hot, sunny and sheltered situations,
when out for the summer; and are better not watered over their heads, but at the roots only.</p>

<p>The present species was raised from Cape seeds last season, in the collection of G. Hibbert, esq.
where our drawing was made in July. Mr. Ross, Nurseryman at Stoke Newington, has also raised it
from Cape seeds, and flowered it in July; and he likewise very fortunately flowered at the same time
several fine specimens of M. rostratum; the fructifications of which have not been produced before in
Europe, that we know of, although the plant has been common in the English gardens ever since the
year 1732, and is one of the very few which Dillenius thought proper to figure without flowers, in his
celebrated Hortus Elthamensis.</p>

the Hortus Kewensis, but marks no time for its flowering; which therefore, we must suppose, but
seldom occurs. Our specimen was obligingly sent us by T. Evans, esq. from his fine collection at
Stepney in June 1803, and we last month saw it beautifully in bloom at the honourable Charles
Greville’s, Paddington.</p>

<p>In the colour of its flowers, and in other particulars, it appears to vary. Plukenet calls them rubicund:
ours were white: and in the extensive herbarium of A. B. Lambert, esq. we have examined a Saint
Helena specimen with purple flowers, and less hoary but more reticulated leaves, which wanted the
minute ferruginous spotting so abundant upon ours. It is propagated by cuttings in the usual way.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Although a very tender hot-house species, it flowers freely in the tan-bed, in rich earth; but its elegant
flowers, like those of Amaryllis ornata, which it also resembles in foliage, are of very short duration,
and do not individually last in full beauty longer than a day; unless they are taken out of the hot-house
as soon as expanded, and placed in some cool apartment; which indeed they well deserve. Our figure

2. A chive.
3. A transverse section of the seed-bud. 4. A capsule.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, but that the plant here figured is the true “Nymphæa Lotus” of Linnæus,
and that it is the plant mentioned by Pliny in Nat. Hist. lib. 13. cap. 17. and lib. 22. cap. 21. He
there makes mention of a plant which is found at the ebbing of the Nile, the fruit of which resembles
a poppy, and the seed of the size of millet: this exactly answers to the “Nymphæa” before us, and
does not at all apply to the “Nelumbium,” the kernels of which are of the size of nuts or thereabouts:
he also remarks that the heads are dried by the natives, and that the seed is beat and broken and made
into bread.&mdash;Herodotus also mentions that the Egyptians baked the seed into bread, and ate of the roots,
or rather tubercles, which resembled an apple and had an agreeable flavour. Vide Euterpe 92&mdash;Melpomene
177.</p>

<p>Sonnini, in his Voyages, mentions the Lotus as being most abundant in Egypt, and having <i>white
flowers</i>; and I apprehend the red one to be nothing but a variety of this.</p>

<p>When we know that the Egyptians worship the Nile, as the Indians do the Ganges, we cannot
wonder that a plant so beautiful, and so abundant in that river, should also become an object of adoration;
and we find it continually though roughly engraved on their idols.&mdash;Indeed Pierius, in his Hieroglyphics,
mentions that the Egyptians worshipped the Lotus as the type of the rising Sun.&mdash;It is always
found on the statues of Osiris, the Egyptian Apollo; it is also to be seen on the medals struck in Egypt
by the Romans, and especially during the reign of Adrian, who held it in such veneration, that the medals
which that Emperor caused to be struck in Egypt, in honour of his favourite Antinoüs, uniformly
represent the latter with the Lotus on his head; whence the expression “Antinoëan crown.”&mdash;Various
animals in the Hieroglyphics appear to have it, as the hawk, the lion, and the ram. It is to be seen on
most of, though not all, their deities; as Jupiter Ammon, Iris, Serapis, Orus, Canopus, and most
particularly on Harpocrates, who is often figured sitting in the midst of it.&mdash;See Cuper’s Harpocrates,
passim. The Lotus symbolizes Plenty on many of the medals of Egypt and Sicily, probably from being
so great an article of food among the inhabitants, and from its generally appearing at the reflux of the
Nile, when the banks were again open to the various uses they might be put to. Whether or not the
Lotus here figured, which I think I have sufficiently proved to be the true Egyptian one, is the same
which grows in the Ganges, and is in such high veneration throughout the continent of India, China,
and Japan, can only be proved by a comparison of the two together: certain however it is, that a plant
of great similarity to it, if not quite the same, is to be found on most of their idols also; and as the
Ganges is worshipped so may the Lotus be, with which it abounds. It expands in the dusk of the
evening, and closes about ten in the morning.</p>

interesting plant, accompanied by a fine living specimen from his splendid collection at White Knights

<p>It is allied to the tuberous-rooted species; and perhaps nearer to Fumaria nobilis than any other: succeeds
very well in a mixture of peat earth and loam, but prefers a sheltered and a somewhat shaded

and fleshy leaves; which all the African species of that genus have: hence it approximates, in habit
at least, the genus Phalangium of Jussieu, which Willdenow makes a division only of Anthericum.</p>

<p>But there is nothing peculiarly remarkable in the present species differing a little from its African
congeners, because most of the Australasian plants differ in some very striking particular or other from
their nearest affinities in all other parts of the world; and very often constitute new genera.</p>

<p>It succeeds with the treatment of the Cape species, loves water, when in active growth; continues

not find the name in any other book: neither can we, for want of sufficient specimens, ascertain whether
it is specifically distinct from Stewartia virginica, or a variety only of that species. From S. virginica,
however, as figured by Cavanilles in his Dissertationes, (tab. 159) it appears to differ, in having
larger and much less serrated leaves, and in their being villose beneath; and likewise in its larger
and entirely white petals. Cavanilles’ plant has one of its petals of a yellow-green colour. From
Stewartia Malachodendron it is known, at first sight, by its entire, not lacerated petals; independent
of the other <i>generical</i> distinctions, according to Jussieu and Cavanilles, which exist between them.</p>

yellow, like those of hirsuta and paniculata; it rises to the height of a foot and a half, prospers with
the usual treatment of Cape Bulbs; and was communicated to us in flower, in June last, by
W. Anderson, botanic gardener to J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore, where it flowers in great perfection,

the three outer being entirely of the nature of a calyx; and effectually answering the purposes of one.</p>

<p>The tuberous-rooted Commelina is a native of Mexico, and in this country requires the treatment
of a hot-house herbaceous plant. It is an old, but not common inhabitant of the British gardens;
thrives well in rich earth, and is propagated by dividing the tubers of its root, when in a quiescent
state; at which period much water is particularly inimical to it.</p>

<p>The genus Commelina can only be distinguished from Tradescantia when the flowers are open; but
nevertheless differs very sufficiently, not only in having double the number of stamina, but more
especially in the extraordinary cruciform nectaries.</p>

Eucalypti, several years ago; but has never flowered in Britain until the present summer, in Lady de
Clifford’s collection at Paddington, where our drawing was made in July last.</p>

<p>It is a shrub of considerable size, and handsome growth and foliage; and its younger shoots droop
considerably, after the very elegant manner so much admired in the weeping willow.</p>

<p>But the most singular trait in the plant is its tardy and protracted mode of flowering. It has already
shown flowers, which it will not expand until next July: they are scarce half the size they will then
be, and have upon the tip of the large calyptra one of a far smaller size, but similar in shape, and
which will soon fall off, as will also the large one, a little previous to the expansion of the stamina
next July.</p>

<p>It requires a great deal of root-room, and rich earth; is a very hardy green-house plant, and has
hitherto been propagated by imported seeds only.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Serratula spicata is a native of Carolina; but has been cultivated in the gardens of this country
ever since the year 1732; notwithstanding which it is by no means a frequent plant in collections;
which I should conceive arises from its being rather difficult to increase.</p>

<p>Although a syngenesious plant, its root is of the tuberous kind; which is a peculiarity almost unparalleled
in that extensive class. The flowering-stems shoot up late in spring, and are chiefly simple:
they rise to the height of one or two feet, furnished with long linear leaves; the uppermost of which
are gradually shortened, and they are all more or less ciliated near the base; but in this respect they
are either liable to differ very considerably, or there are several varieties (perhaps species) of the plant.
There is likewise another strikingly singular trait in the character of this Serratula: the flowers commence
opening at the top of the spike first, and continue flowering downwards; instead of upwards, in
the usual manner; which is a circumstance I cannot recollect having seen in any other plants; except
Agave virginica and Allium descendens. Cultivators usually suppose the name of the last-mentioned
plant to apply to its roots striking deep into the earth: but this we apprehend is an erroneous supposition;
for it is clearly allusive to its perverted mode of flowering.</p>

<p>The spiked-flowered Saw-wort flowers in July, loves a light soil in the open air; and is propagated,
although slowly, by parting its roots after the stems die down.</p>

<p>Gmelin queries, and with propriety, in his edition of <i>Systema Naturæ</i> above cited, whether S. spicata,
and S. squarrosa, (another North American species,) are not generically distinct from the other
Serratulæ.</p>

material manner from the Convolvulus grandiflorus as described in the Supplementum Plantarum, and
consequently in Willdenow’s Species Plantarum, which is there said to be an arborescent species: from
C. grandiflorus it should also appear to differ, in its more pointed leaves and solitary peduncles; and
likewise in having a stigma agreeing altogether in structure with the genus Ipomæa; which latter circumstance
has occasioned us to separate it from Convolvulus, and transfer it to Ipomæa; because
the conformation of the stigma in those extensive genera, often (but we fear not always) affords the
most satisfactory characters for discrimination. All their species which we have examined, (and they

<p>They are all water plants, and could no more thrive with their roots and natant leaves out of that
element than an Aloe or Stapelia could prosper in it: they are therefore, along with other tropical
aquatics, cultivated in our hot-houses in troughs or cisterns of rich earth and clear water; in which,
consociated with the majestic Nymphææ, the stately Thalia, and the more humble but not less interesting
Menyanthes indica, they produce a most fragrant and desirable appearance; that perhaps
is indebted for some of its charms to the fine contrast formed by the terrestrial exotics which surround

<p>In a collection of tropical plants, where a few cisterns of aquatics are judiciously interspersed, the
oppressive heat of the stove in which they grow, is as it were delusively alleviated, “in the mind’s eye,”
by the simple, yet cooling sight of the little pools of water in which they float. Few are the number
of observers who contemplate them without imbibing pleasure. This unquestionably arises from the
strong but agreeable contrast that is exhibited to the eye, by the happy junction of the productions of
the waters with those of the earth. They are vegetables of widely different orders&mdash;productions of
very different natures&mdash;and inhabitants of elements diametrically opposite.</p>

<p>The simple-spiked Aponogeton produces roundish tubers in various parts of its shoots; by the
transplantation of which the plant is readily and speedily propagated. Our drawing of it was made in
July last, at J. Vere’s, Esq. Kensington Gore, in whose collection it thrives very well. We have not

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> genus Dahlia was first established by the celebrated botanist Cavanilles<a id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>, (in honour of Andrew
Dahl, a Swedish botanist, not Dale an Englishman,) for three lofty, thick-rooted, perennial plants,
natives of the distant regions of Peru; but all of which we have had the recent pleasure of seeing
alive in the overflowing gardens of our own happy country. They are extremely desirable and
showy plants; and none of them more so than the present one; which was raised from seeds sent
from Madrid last spring, by the Right Hon. Lady Holland, and flowered last September and October,
in the open ground, in her Ladyship’s collection at Holland House, Kensington; where our drawing was
lately made. It has acquired the stately height of near eight feet, with a circumference of three; and
makes indeed a truly specious appearance: but we do not expect it will ripen its seeds; the season
being too far advanced to encourage any reasonable hope of that nature.</p>

<p>The best mode of propagation should seem to be that of dividing its somewhat tuberous roots, after
the stems die down. As to treatment, we see no valid reason why it, and both the other Dahliæ, (the
coccinea and rosea,) should not be treated as hardy herbaceous plants; placed in rich earth and a warm
situation. But as they are both rare and valuable, it may at present be safer to consider them as green-house
plants, keeping them in very large pots and well watered, until their stems show symptoms of
dying down; when moisture must be administered with a sparing hand.</p>

<p>There are considerable reasons for thinking that the pinnated Dahlia will hereafter be raised with double
flowers, because the figure in Cavanilles’ Icones, above cited, represents them nearly semi-double; and
the doubling of radiated syngenesious plants is well known to horticulturists to be a circumstance of
pretty frequent occurrence.</p>

long been an inhabitant of European conservatories, although a rare one. It was well known to
several of the old botanists, who appear to have differed much concerning the generical appellations which
they thought proper to bestow upon it; as will appear on consulting the synonyms above. They made
several genera of Proteæ; but the botanists of later times have melted them all down (we fear injudiciously)
into one great genus: and Schrader has even added Lambertia to Protea; and figured it in his
Sertum Hannoverianum, under the name of Protea nectarina; thereby alluding to the sweet juice
which abounds in the tubes of its flowers:&mdash;melliflua would have been a still more expressive term.
The smooth-leaved Protea requires the same treatment as the rest of the genus, and is a very fine species,
producing its flowers in May and June. Our figure was taken at the Clapham collection.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

C. reticulatum is also a native of the same country, the East Indies; from whence seeds of the undatum

of the unusual delicacy in the veining and spotting of its flowers; which, from their size and number,
make a good appearance; and are produced in succession most part of the year. The plant itself is
of very humble, scarcely shrubby growth; yet rises somewhat higher than the real tuberous species;
to which, however, in its contracted, thickened stems, it betrays a considerable affinity. It is propagated

the time of Dillenius, and is figured by him, in the <i>Hort. Elth.</i> above cited, as a species of <i>Quamoclit</i>,
it has been an entire stranger to our modern gardens until very lately; having no doubt long since
perished in all the old collections.</p>

<p>Who the reintroducer of this very elegant plant is, we have yet to learn: but the beautiful specimen
here figured, was obligingly communicated to us by the Marquis of Blandford, from White Knights,
Berks, about the end of November last.</p>

<p>It is a native of Carolina, and sufficiently hardy, we should think, to resist the cold of our ordinary
winters: its root is herbaceous, and the plant admits of increase by parting the same, in spring or
autumn.</p>

<p>Writers have differed in a very remarkable manner concerning the Genus to which they should refer
this plant; and Linnæus himself seems to have been as undetermined as any of them concerning it;
having at different times given it as a <i>Polemonium</i>, and an <i>Ipomea</i>; as will appear among our synonyms
above. Michaux has called it <i>Ipomopsis</i>: and another foreign writer, whose work we have not got, has
given it the appellation of <i>Noothea Pulchella</i>: but Willdenow has added it to the genus <i>Cantua</i>, with
which we conceive, in our humble opinion, it sufficiently accords; and have therefore ventured to
follow him in his arrangement of it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Our</span> drawing was made from plants in the Hibbertian collection at Clapham last autumn: but we have
also seen this Sage in other places; particularly at Cambridge; and know it to be the Salvia Chamædrifolia
of the Hortus Cantabrigiensis ed. 3.: but we do not find that name in any other publication
within our reach.</p>

<p>Mr. Donn marks it as a green-house perennial, and gives Spain as its native country, but with a note
of interrogation; and adds that it flowers in July and August; and that it was introduced into our gardens
in the year 1798.</p>

<p>We believe that A. B. Lambert, Esq. was the first introducer of it, and that gentleman thinks he
received the seeds of it from Spain. The first time of our seeing it was at J. Vere’s, Esq. in the
autumn of 1802, where it was cultivated as a green-house shrub, and by the name of S. citrina, a
name that well expresses the charming odour of its leaves when gently rubbed; which not a little
resembles the pleasing, well-known scent of Lemon Thyme.</p>

<p>It is propagated by cuttings in the usual way: its stem and branches are very slender, but shrubby,
and arise to the height of two or three feet. The flowers are terminal, large, showy, and posses
a beautiful colour of the deepest blue.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> species of Crotolaria here represented, may perhaps be the “C. (pilosa) foliis ternatis pilosis, foliolis
mucronatis, floribus terminalibus,” of Thunberg’s Prodromus: but from so insufficient a character we have
not ventured to determine it to be that plant; having rather chosen to give it as a new species by the
name of Pulchella; which it well deserves.</p>

<p>It is a green-house plant, a native we understand of the Cape; and arises with a straight, but little
branched, woody stem, to the height of about 3 feet: the branches are cylindrical and silky: the
leaves alternate and ternate, inclining to hoary, with pubescent and channelled foot-stalks:
the leaflets are lance-shaped, or linear-lanced, once and an half, or sometimes twice the length of
their common foot-stalk, and furnished beneath with minute, close-pressed hairs: the flowers are
in a terminal racemus, large, yellow, and showy; and are produced in the month of July.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have seen this plant only at the Nursery of Messrs. Colvill, in the King’s Road, where
our drawing was made. In favourable seasons the plant will probably ripen its seeds in this country:
and at other times we have no doubt of its being capable of propagation by cuttings in the usual way;
although we do not know that this has yet actually been done.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

edition of Species Plantarum, or the Hortus Kewensis of Mr. Aiton; except by the former of these
authors, as being synonymous with G. Saponaria; from which as a species we conceive it distinct:
neither do we find it enumerated in Mr. Donn’s Hortus Cantabrigiensis: but it is described by Walter
in his Flora Caroliniana, under the name of Catesbæi; and is known in several of the principal gardens
in the neighbourhood of London by that appellation; which we have therefore thought it more eligible
to adopt, than run any risk of occasioning confusion by applying a new one.</p>

<p>The plant is perennial and herbaceous, a native of Carolina, and is propagated by parting its roots
in autumn, or early spring; but requires a moist sheltered situation, and peat earth in the open air,
to make it flourish.</p>

<p>It rises with several stems to the height of a foot or upwards: the leaves are opposite, or in threes,
remote, lanceolate, stem-clasping, and obscurely three-nerved, with scabrous margins, occasioned by
minute, upwardly-directed serrulations, which at the base of the leaf are decurrent, and form four
or six roughened lines on the stem: the flowers are irregularly whorled; but the uppermost whorl is
by much the largest; each blossom is of a rich deep purple colour, ventricose, and opens very little
at the mouth, where it is divided into ten incurving segments, every other of which is of a much paler
colour than the rest, broader, unequally bifid, and minutely lacerated: the empalement is five-cleft,
and its segments are linear-lance-shaped, with minutely ciliated edges, after the manner of the edges
of the leaves.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Portugal Genista is a very spiny, and almost leafless shrub, of bushy growth; and although very
well known to most of the old Botanists, does not appear to have been cultivated in the British gardens
until the year 1771; when, according to Mr. Aiton’s Hortus Kewensis, it was introduced by Mrs.
Primmet. It is a native of Portugal and Spain, but is sufficiently hardy to resist the cold of our ordinary
winters, if planted in a sheltered situation: yet is extremely liable to be injured, or even destroyed,
in those which take place with rigour and severity: but as it very frequently produces good
seeds, a supply of it is not difficult to be kept up that way. The best time of sowing them is spring,
and they will require some slight protection from frost while young.</p>

<p>The plant blooms freely from March till May, and when decorated with its golden flowers, makes
a very ornamental appearance in the shrubbery; in which, although it has been so long in cultivation,
we cannot help regretting that it but seldom occurs: and we venture to recommend it along
with G. germanica (a closely allied species) to the further attention of our cultivating friends.</p>

<p>Like many other shrubby leguminous plants, this Genista is averse to being frequently transplanted;
and never suffers the operation of removal with impunity. Let that business therefore, when necessary,
be performed with all possible diligence and care. Our figure was taken from plants in the
Clapham collection.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

many flowers; whence our specific name of floribundum.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> new and elegant plant here figured was obligingly communicated to us in September last by
A. B. Lambert, Esq. who informs us that it had grown vigorously to the height of about three feet in
the bark-bed of his hot-house, without showing flowers; but that, on being removed from the tan and
placed upon the flue, it soon produced those which we have here delineated; whence it is probable that
the check to its growth, occasioned by the mere change of situation, was the cause of its blooming, as in
other collections it has not hitherto done it. Mr. L. likewise informs us that its native country is Coromandel,
and that it is intended for publication by Dr. Roxburgh under the name of Amomum calcaratum;
and showed us a drawing of it, so named, copied from one that was made in the East Indies from
a native specimen, and which represents the plant somewhat slenderer and less upright than the individual
we have here depicted.</p>

<p>Whoever will carefully investigate and compare our dissected figures of this plant with those which
are given with Renealmia nutans on our 360th plate, will not only find that they precisely agree with
each other (as much as two distinct species of plants can do), but that both of them very sufficiently
correspond with the essential characters of the genus Renealmia: yet both are, no doubt, specifically
distinct from Renealmia exaltata; wherefore we have not hesitated to withdraw the present plant
from the genus Amomum, from which, independent of its widely different mode of flowering,
we believe it to be generically distinct. Neither are the above-mentioned all the species of
Renealmia we have a knowledge of; for even in the British gardens (exclusive of those which
have not yet been introduced to us alive) we are already acquainted with at least three more.
But how far some of these plants are distinct from the four diandrous Globbæ enumerated by
Willdenow, and from Schrader’s Zerumbet speciosum, which is a true Renealmia, we are not at present
prepared to determine; yet cannot help remarking that the last-mentioned plant should seem to resemble
the Globba Japonica of Thunberg;&mdash;that our present subject may resemble G. Marantina;&mdash;that
G. nutans greatly resembles Renealmia nutans; and that at least one of the figures cited by Willdenow
for the former in Rumphius, is absolutely the same as R. nutans:&mdash;and, lastly, that R. exaltata
of Linn. Supp. Pl. possesses, in a very striking and remarkable manner, the extraordinary habit of the
remaining Globba uviformis.</p>

<p>As to culture, these are all stove plants, and in this country require the assistance of the tan-bed to
make them flourish. Rich earth and great plenty of pot-room are likewise requisite, and also a large
portion of water when they are vegetating briskly, but less when they are almost at a stand,&mdash;which is
sometimes the case,&mdash;although they are never perfectly quiescent, as is common in the neighbouring
genus Amomum. They are propagated easily by parting their perennial roots.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> species of Crotolaria here represented is a native of Malabar and the coast of Coromandel.
It was obligingly sent us in bloom last August by the Hon. Mr. Irby, of Farnham Royal, Bucks, and
was raised by him from East Indian seeds. Its root is annual; and the plant, in consequence of it,
admits of increase by seeds only, which should be sown early on a hot-bed, with the most tender
annuals, and the young plants when large enough should be transplanted into separate pots of rich
earth; and after they have sufficiently recovered the effects of removal, they should be taken into the
hot-house, the assistance of which is requisite to bring them to maturity. They rise with slender and
rather rushy stems, which are but slightly branched, to the height of two or three feet, and make a fine
appearance when in flower; but they are, like many other tender leguminous plants, very subject to the
annoyance of insects, and more especially to that almost indestructible pest of stoves, the red spider;
the best mode of destroying which is that of steaming the plants; that is, keeping them well watered,
and in a hot and humid air.</p>

<p>Some of our friends conceive this plant to differ from that which is figured in the Botanical Magazine,
No. 490. It is true, I found the seed-bud quite silky; and if the full grown pod (which I never
saw<a id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>) should likewise be so, it would certainly be worthy distinguishing from that plant, which is said
to have smooth, and therefore, in all probability, naked pods.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> Neither have I yet seen the pod of the Crotolaria figured in the last number, which, if it should prove cylindrical
and not turgid, would refer that plant to the genus Lebeckia, with which in habit it very well accords.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p></div>

to the great variety of that description already given in this work. As a species it appears
sufficiently distinct from any of them, although pretty closely allied to that which is delineated in our
last number; and also to G. fissifolium of our 378th plate. Its flowers are yellow marked with red,
as is frequently the case amongst the tuberous species of this extensive tribe of plants, but of very rare
occurrence in the other departments of it.</p>

<p>From the Clapham collection, incomparably rich in this description of plants, our figure was
derived, so long since as the summer of the year 1803.</p>

<p>Like its congeners, it is a native of the Cape; requires the treatment of a green-house plant; and
is increased, but very slowly, by carefully dividing the tubers of its roots, when quiescent; taking
especial care that no moisture comes in contact with the wounded parts, until nature has healed them
by drying, and formed what the gardeners call a callus; that is, a dry and hardened external skin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">There</span> is an elegance and a grace in the habit and appearance of this Polygala, which in a great measure
compensates for its trifling flowers. It forms a small, and but little branched, twiggy shrub; is a
native of the Cape of Good Hope; and belongs to the Heisteria division of the genus. We do
not know that it has ever been figured before; but, notwithstanding the short character given by Thunberg,
have little doubt of its being the plant he intended for P. micrantha. The honour of introducing
it, and also some other shrubby Polygalæ, into this country, is due to G. Hibbert, Esq., from
whose choice collection at Clapham our figure was taken.</p>

<p>Polygala micrantha continues flowering the greatest part of the year, winter as well as summer, is
a very hardy green-house plant, and is propagated by cuttings in the usual way.</p>

<p>If we were to consider the flowers as resupinate, and perhaps they really are so, what we have called
the keel would become the standard, and the small appendage which is a part of it below would answer
as its keel. The expanded flowers of this species, and also those of P. stipulacea of our 363d plate,
viewed in front, very remarkably resemble in outline, and almost in size, the insects which I have
named Tineæ Bombyciformes; but the wings of the flower, which answer to the pectinated horns of
the insects, appear rather too large. P. alopecuroides of our 371st plate possesses this extraordinary
resemblance still more completely; inasmuch as the ciliæ of its keel correspond exactly to the fringes
of the insects’ wings! A more perfect similitude between objects in reality so remote and so different, I
have very rarely, or never, beheld.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Mango tree very seldom produces its flowers, and, we believe, never perfects its fruit, or, as Miller
calls it, its plum, in Europe. In India this tree acquires considerable size, with a rough bark, and
luxuriant foliage, and its fruit is held in great esteem. For the sake of its fine leaves alone it is
worthy cultivation in our hot-houses, where, according to Miller, it prospers better out of, than in the
tan; yet I believe most of the horticulturists of the present day prefer the bark-bed for their Mangoes,
planting them in rich earth and large pots. They are propagated by layers or cuttings, seldom by
seeds, because these will not keep long after they are mature, and therefore perish before they reach
this country and can be sown in it. The flowers are extremely trifling, but they are curious in their
conformation, and remarkable in constantly having four out of their five chives abortive, imperfect,
and destitute of anthers; wherefore the plant is monandrous. Our figure was taken at Whitley and
Brames’s in the month of December last.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>No coloured representation of this magnificent plant within our knowledge has yet been published,
either in this country or on the continent; but a large folio black print of it was given in Aiton’s
Hortus Kewensis, along with the above specific character, and with the circumstance of its having
been introduced into the British gardens by the late Dr. Fothergill, in the year 1778, from China; of
which country it is a native. In England it requires the artificial heat of the tan-bed to make it
flower, which it does annually, with good management, from the month of November to that of
April. It requires rich earth, and in dry weather frequent waterings; when in bloom makes a very
stately appearance, and is propagated pretty readily by parting the tubers of the roots. Our drawing
was made from fine plants in the Hibbertian collection at Clapham last month.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

Botany, tab. 5, than to any other genus within our knowledge; yet the dissections here given, will
be found to swerve from the characters there advanced, in several perhaps not unimportant particulars.
The stamina appear more united. The stigma appears slightly capitated, instead of acute; and
the infant pod somewhat too long. The bracteæ also differ in number as well as structure.</p>

its species the annuum, with its supposed variety the inapertum, divided and arranged exactly after
the manner proposed in our account of X. bracteatum (Plate 375), now Elychrisum bracteatum:

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Protea incurva is a native of the Cape of Good Hope, which is also the native country of by
far the greater part of this extensive genus.</p>

<p>In this country it is considered and treated as a hardy green-house plant; and requires, like most of
its congeners, a fresh loamy soil, and an airy situation in the winter. A very abundant supply of
fresh air, indeed, is of essential consequence in the cultivation of most of the Cape plants; they
benefit by it in the day time in most sorts of weather, even if rainy, provided the plants are not wetted
by the rain, and the temperature of the atmosphere is not lower than forty degrees of Fahrenheit’s
thermometer.</p>

<p>In many collections, we are of opinion, too little air is usually admitted in the green-house; especially
in winter, and early spring: and we are also of opinion, that where we have seen the most
given, the plants are the most healthy and robust. The fine collection at Mr. Hibbert’s is a
powerful argument in favour of this theory.&mdash;In few places is air so freely given; in none are plants
in finer health: therefore much air is essentially necessary; for plants, like animals, are now known to
absorb from the atmosphere, through a process analogous to respiration, its oxygenous particles; thence
deriving strength and vigour, and without which no animal or vegetable can at all maintain either
health or life.</p>

<p>Our figure was made from the Clapham Collection last June. The plant is shrubby, erect, and
is propagated by cuttings in the usual way.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> species of Ricinus here depicted, was raised in Lady Holland’s garden at Kensington last summer,
from seeds sent by her ladyship from Malta, where the plant has been cultivated for medicinal
purposes about four years; and where it is considered as a new sort. And such indeed it appears to
us: for as a species, although it comes extremely near to R. communis, R. inermis, and perhaps R. medicus
of Forskall, it appears to be sufficiently distinct; differing from the former and latter, in its deeper
cloven, and more numerously lobed, and glandular petioled leaves; and from R. inermis, in having
its capsules thickly beset with considerable, but herbaceous spines; whence our specific name of
armatus, in contradistinction also to R. inermis, which has smooth capsules. The plant from which
our drawing was taken was eight feet high and very much branched; and its ample yet elegant foliage,
and red stalks and veins, communicated that kind of appearance to it which is often attributed to
Asiatic plants&mdash;stately, and magnificent. Its root is biennial; it requires the protection of the green-house,
and can be increased very readily by seeds, which should be raised on a hot-bed in spring,
and afterwards transplanted into very large pots. There were two glands at the top of the petioles.</p>

<p>The valuable drug called castor oil is extracted from the seeds of this and other species of Ricinus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Few of our cultivating friends, except those who are the most botanical, will be inclined to add this
Cæsulia to their collections; although a very rare, and, in many respects, an interesting species.</p>

<p>It was first described and figured by Dr. Roxburgh, as a new genus, and by the name it here bears,
in his sumptuous work on the plants of the coast of Coromandel, of which country it is a native;
and it has since been taken up by Professor Willdenow, in his edition of Species Plantarum, and
has had a new species (the <i>radicans</i>), from Guinea, added to it by that botanist.</p>

<p>The axillary-flowered Cæsulia is quite new in the gardens, and is said to have a perennial root, by
the parting of which we suppose it may be increased; and must be considered as a hot-house plant
in this country.</p>

<p>Our figure was taken from a living specimen, obligingly communicated to us last summer by the
Marquis of Blandford, from White Knights, Berks; who, we believe, first raised it in this country,
from East Indian seeds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">At</span> the request of several of our subscribers, who compliment us in saying this work contains nearly
all the more showy plants now in cultivation; and who moreover are desirous that it should not long
want any of them: we here beg leave to present them with that queen of hot-house plants, the
superb Strelitzia: although strictly against our rules and plan; a coloured quarto print of it having
already been given in the Botanical Magazine.</p>

<p>Of this majestic genus, first established in the Hortus Kewensis, there are now living in the British
gardens, not fewer than four species, and several varieties; all natives, we believe, of the Cape of
Good Hope, and all hot-house plants: viz. 1st, Strelitzia alba (Hortulanorum), which, towering far
above the rest, and quite erect, attains the kingly height of twenty feet or upwards: it ought to have
been called S. Regis;&mdash;2nd, S. Reginæ, here delineated, of which there are three or four varieties,
differing only in the undulation of the leaves, and in their length, which (including the petiole) is
usually from three to five feet;&mdash;3d, A nondescript narrow-leaved species, with very long petioles;
this should be called S. Principis;&mdash;and 4th, another nondescript, but smaller sort, whose leaves are
mere petioles, and scarce ever expand in the slightest manner into laminæ: this should be called
S. juncea: it is very rare, and we believe at present only in the royal collection at Kew. All the
Strelitziæ are propagated, though slowly, by carefully dividing their perennial roots, which are usually
planted either in very large pots, or small beds annexed to the tan-bed in hot-houses. Our figure was
made from a plant at Messrs. Colvill’s, in the King’s Road, last autumn, but the plant flowers freely at
various seasons.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
